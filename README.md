# NumOptML
NUMOPTML is a pure NumPy-based machine learning library focused on implementing optimization techniques and automatic differentiation for research and practical applications. The library is designed to provide efficient optimization methods while keeping it simple and easy to understand.
### Features
- Optimization Algorithms: Gradient Descent, Momentum, Wolfe Conditions (Planned: Learning Rate Prediction with Reinforcement Learning)
- Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression (Planned: Ridge Regression, Softmax Regression, etc.)
- Automatic Differentiation: Efficient computation of gradients for optimization
- Fully NumPy-Based: No external dependencies beyond NumPy
### Installation
NUMOPTML is currently in development. To try it out, clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NUMOPTML.git
cd NUMOPTML
```
### Usage
Here's a simple example of using Linear Regression with NUMOPTML:
```python
import numpy as np
from numoptml.models.linear_regression import LinearRegression

# Sample Data
X = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5]])
y = np.array([5, 7, 9, 11])

# Initialize and Train Model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predictions
predictions = model.predict(X)
print("Predictions:", predictions)
```
